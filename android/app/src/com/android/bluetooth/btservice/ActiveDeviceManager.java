/**
 * The active device manager is responsible for keeping track of the
 * connected A2DP/HFP/AVRCP/HearingAid/LE audio devices and select which device is
 * active (for each profile).
 * The active device manager selects a fallback device when the currently active device
 * is disconnected, and it selects BT devices that are lastly activated one.
 *
 * Current policy (subject to change):
 * 1) If the maximum number of connected devices is one, the manager doesn't
 *    do anything. Each profile is responsible for automatically selecting
 *    the connected device as active. Only if the maximum number of connected
 *    devices is more than one, the rules below will apply.
 * 2) The selected A2DP active device is the one used for AVRCP as well.
 * 3) The HFP active device might be different from the A2DP active device.
 * 4) The Active Device Manager always listens for ACTION_ACTIVE_DEVICE_CHANGED
 *    broadcasts for each profile:
 *    - BluetoothA2dp.ACTION_ACTIVE_DEVICE_CHANGED for A2DP
 *    - BluetoothHeadset.ACTION_ACTIVE_DEVICE_CHANGED for HFP
 *    - BluetoothHearingAid.ACTION_ACTIVE_DEVICE_CHANGED for HearingAid
 *    - BluetoothLeAudio.ACTION_LE_AUDIO_ACTIVE_DEVICE_CHANGED for LE audio
 *    If such broadcast is received (e.g., triggered indirectly by user
 *    action on the UI), the device in the received broadcast is marked
 *    as the current active device for that profile.
 * 5) If there is a HearingAid active device, then A2DP, HFP and LE audio active devices
 *    must be set to null (i.e., A2DP, HFP and LE audio cannot have active devices).
 *    The reason is that A2DP, HFP or LE audio cannot be used together with HearingAid.
 * 6) If there are no connected devices (e.g., during startup, or after all
 *    devices have been disconnected, the active device per profile
 *    (A2DP/HFP/HearingAid/LE audio) is selected as follows:
 * 6.1) The last connected HearingAid device is selected as active.
 *      If there is an active A2DP, HFP or LE audio device, those must be set to null.
 * 6.2) The last connected A2DP, HFP or LE audio device is selected as active.
 *      However, if there is an active HearingAid device, then the
 *      A2DP, HFP, or LE audio active device is not set (must remain null).
 * 7) If the currently active device (per profile) is disconnected, the
 *    Active Device Manager just marks that the profile has no active device,
 *    and the lastly activated BT device that is still connected would be selected.
 * 8) If there is already an active device, and the corresponding
 *    ACTION_ACTIVE_DEVICE_CHANGED broadcast is received, the device
 *    contained in the broadcast is marked as active. However, if
 *    the contained device is null, the corresponding profile is marked
 *    as having no active device.
 * 9) If a wired audio device is connected, the audio output is switched
 *    by the Audio Framework itself to that device. We detect this here,
 *    and the active device for each profile (A2DP/HFP/HearingAid/LE audio) is set
 *    to null to reflect the output device state change. However, if the
 *    wired audio device is disconnected, we don't do anything explicit
 *    and apply the default behavior instead:
 * 9.1) If the wired headset is still the selected output device (i.e. the
 *      active device is set to null), the Phone itself will become the output
 *      device (i.e., the active device will remain null). If music was
 *      playing, it will stop.
 * 9.2) If one of the Bluetooth devices is the selected active device
 *      (e.g., by the user in the UI), disconnecting the wired audio device
 *      will have no impact. E.g., music will continue streaming over the
 *      active Bluetooth device.
